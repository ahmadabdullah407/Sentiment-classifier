# Sentiment-classifier
## Description:
This is a sentiment classifier, which will detect how positive or negative each tweet is. We will create a csv file, which contains columns for the Number of Retweets, Number of Replies, Positive Score (which is how many happy words are in the tweet), Negative Score (which is how many angry words are in the tweet), and the Net Score for each tweet. We will have to provide .txt file for positive and negative words each
## Requirements:
- This code needs [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) to run.
- This code requires 3 files in the Project folder named as follows:
  1. "positive_words.txt" (which provides all the positive words).
  2. "negative_words.txt" (which provides all the negative words).
  3. "project_twitter_data.csv" (which provide twitter data we need to check).
## Execution:
- After the requirements are met the code will execute.
- Result would be a [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file named "resulting_data.csv" .
- This [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file will provide 'Number of Retweets, Number of Replies, Positive Score, Negative Score, Net Score' for each tweet.
